# HTML files used to work around browser & Jenkins Content Security Policies
The HTML generated by Chapel's start_test uses JavaScript & CSS from an external CDN. This causes Chrome (but not Firefox) to not load the files due to their content security policy (cross site scripting security vulnerabilities). Current versions of Jenkins also block this type of script loading due to a similar policy. See https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Configuring+Content+Security+Policy for more info.

The Jenkinsfile build script copies the files in this directory over the top of the generated ones. The files here reference locally stored JavaScript & CSS versus retrieving them from an external CDN.
